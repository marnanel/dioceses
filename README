This is a collection of data which is used to make
maps of the dioceses of the Episcopal Church (TEC)
for Wikipedia.

More documentation will follow here shortly.

The Navajo Area Mission is still unaccounted for,
but will be added shortly.

Where possible, all data and code in this repository
is dedicated to the public domain.
